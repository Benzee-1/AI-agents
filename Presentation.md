 # Introduction
In this document, we try to contribute to beef up tools to improve Apache Airflow lifecycle (from architecture design to root cause analysis ), by adding AI agents to help taking decisions based on gathered data and collecte information. Our objective is not an automation deployment, but is deploying a reasoning engins to solve complex problems by creating an action plan and execute it using tools or API.
We aim to transform Airflow scheduling services from a static behaviour to a dynamic and reactive one with more autonomy.


# OODA loop
OODA loop, Observe/Orient/Decide/Act,  transforms static, reactive systems into dynamic entities capable of autonomous and adaptive behavior.
## Observe :  The system actively collects data from various sources inputs, sensor feeds, and internal knowledge repositories, and builds a real-time picture of the environment. This proactive sensing capability represents the backbone of Agentic AI, it allows to go beyond waiting for prompts.
Orient :
Decide :
Act :



2. Orient

Once the data is collected, Agentic AI interprets and contextualizes the information. Through advanced context analysis, the AI identifies key patterns and nuances, ensuring that its understanding of the situation is both deep and current.

3. Decide

Armed with comprehensive insights, the system evaluates potential actions using tools like decision matrices and risk assessment protocols. This phase is crucial for Agentic AI, as it enables the system to simulate various scenarios and select the most effective, ethical, and contextually appropriate response.

4. Act

Finally, Agentic AI executes the chosen actionâ€”be it generating content, interfacing with other systems, or performing complex tasks. The system then monitors the outcome, using feedback to refine future cycles and continuously improve its performance.


Agent : An AI agent is an individual entity designed to perceive its environment, reason based on input from the user, and act autonomously to achieve a desired result. AI agents can be as simple as an AI assistant connected to internal systems or as complex as self-driving workflows that operate autonomously.
