 # Introduction
In this document, we try to contribute to beef up tools to improve Apache Airflow lifecycle (from architecture design to root cause analysis ), by adding AI agents to help taking decisions based on gathered data and collecte information. Our objective is not an automation deployment, but is deploying a reasoning engins to solve complex problems by creating an action plan and execute it using tools or API.
We aim to transform Airflow scheduling services from a static behaviour to a dynamic and reactive one with more autonomy.


# OODA loop
OODA loop, Observe/Orient/Decide/Act,  transforms static, reactive systems into dynamic entities capable of autonomous and adaptive behavior.
## Observe :  
The system actively collects data from various sources inputs, sensor feeds, and internal knowledge repositories, and builds a real-time picture of the environment. This proactive sensing capability represents the backbone of Agentic AI, it allows to go beyond waiting for prompts.
## Orient : 
In this step,  AI agents will analyze the observed data to understand what is happening. They will compare against known patterns, baseline metrics, and other contextual information.AI ensures that its understanding of the situation is both deep and current.

## Decide :
In decide step, we choose a course of action based on analysis and interpretation during the orientation step. It's important to make a decision aligned with our goals and values and the information we gathered during the observation phase. This step is crucial for Agentic AI, it enables the system to simulate various scenarios and select the most effective, ethical, and contextually appropriate decision.
## Act :
Consists of implementing decisions of the former step, it could be content generation, interfacing with third system or even performing a complex tasks.

The system then monitors the outcome, using feedback to refine future cycles and continuously improve its performance.
