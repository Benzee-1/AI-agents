 # Introduction
In this document, we try to contribute to beef up tools to improve Apache Airflow lifecycle (from architecture design to root cause analysis ), by adding AI agents to help taking decisions based on gathered data and collecte information. Our objective is not an automation deployment, but is deploying a reasoning engins to solve complex problems by creating an action plan and execute it using tools or API.
We aim to transform Airflow scheduling services from a static behaviour to a dynamic and reactive one with more autonomy.
